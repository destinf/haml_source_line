# HamlSourceLine

This gem adds the HAML source line into the resulting HTML. 

With the following HAML file:
```haml
# app/views/user/login.html.haml
%h2 Login Page

%p
  Please login to continue.
```

Will result in the following HTML:
```html
<h2 data-source-line="app/views/user/login.html.haml:1">
  Login Page
</h2>

<p data-source-line="app/views/user/login.html.haml:3">
  Please login to continue.
</p>
```

Note the presence of the `data-source-line` attribute in the resulting tags that point back to the exact line in the haml file.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'haml_source_line', github: 'financeit/haml_source_line'
